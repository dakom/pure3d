This time in Rust!

## Live Coding 

As a way to self-motivate getting over the learning curve (this is my first Rust project), I thought it might help to livestream the coding+learning sessions, and also archive them in a playlist for a look-back.

Here's the permalink to the live stream: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGKhwtFOUlzj4VILDU0efkQ/live
